Spring AI is a framework that simplifies the integration of Large Language Models
into Spring Boot applications. It provides abstractions for chat models, embedding
models, and vector stores, while still allowing developers to keep full control
over prompt construction and data flow.

Oracle Database 23ai introduces native AI Vector Search capabilities. These
capabilities allow developers to store embedding vectors directly inside the
database and perform similarity search using SQL. This removes the need for an
external vector database and enables tighter integration with existing relational
data.

In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, user questions are first
converted into embeddings using an embedding model. These embeddings are then
compared against stored document embeddings to retrieve the most relevant
documents. The retrieved documents are provided as context to a Large Language
Model, which generates a grounded answer.

In this proof of concept, Spring AI uses Oracle Database 23ai as the vector store.
Ollama is used to serve both the embedding model and the chat model locally. The
vector store is responsible for similarity search, while the language model is
responsible only for natural language generation.

This architecture allows developers to build end-to-end AI-powered applications
without sending data to external cloud services. All data, embeddings, and model
inference can run locally or inside a controlled enterprise environment.
